# Retail Media: Value Driver Modelling
NOTE: Due to the nature of this project, code cannot be shared publicly.

My team, myself included, presented on this project at a conference. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MRDjIETPY&list=PLi8BQK-Zsrbj3LpMTQdMFRi7ukkAlsamy&index=16&t=50s) to the recording

## Context
Due to a variety of issues including but not limited to: fragmented ad tech stacks, struggling to integrate tech with new tech, and struggling to generate insights, retailers often struggle to start or upscale their retail media business. 

## Expected Outcomes
- Obtain domain knowledge about retail media
- Granularise summary data to make fit for use
- Create a dashboard modelling value drivers
- Present results to stakeholders

## Tools Used
- PowerBI
- DAX

The final dashboard:


Conclusions
Spring had the most absences
Spring had the highest workload
5 employees (of 36) make up half of all absences
Medical reasons were by far the most common cause of absences
Drinkers took the most unjustified leave (70%)
Reason 15 (medical reason) for absenteeism only happened on Mondays and Fridays
Employees with 4 children took more leave than employees with fewer children
Obese employees made up only a quarter of employees but a third of all medical leave
Recommendations
Reduce or spread out workload in Spring
Engage with and provide support to employees with high numbers of absences
Host events encouraging healthy lifestyles and remodel the office to incentivise healthy choices
Discourage heavy drinking
Provide further support to employees with 4 children, such as providing childcare
