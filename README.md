# Retail Media: Value Driver Modelling
NOTE: Due to the nature of this project, code cannot be shared publicly.

My team, myself included, presented on this project at a conference. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MRDjIETPY&list=PLi8BQK-Zsrbj3LpMTQdMFRi7ukkAlsamy&index=16&t=50s) to the recording

## Context
Due to a variety of issues including but not limited to: fragmented ad tech stacks, struggling to integrate tech with new tech, and struggling to generate insights, retailers often struggle to start or upscale their retail media business. 

## Expected Outcomes
- Obtain domain knowledge about retail media
- Granularise summary data to make fit for use
- Create a dashboard modelling value drivers
- Present results to stakeholders

## Tools Used
- PowerBI
- DAX
- Python
- VS Code
